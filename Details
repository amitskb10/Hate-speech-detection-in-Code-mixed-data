This project focuses on classifying hate speech in Hindi–English code-mixed social media data using a combination of traditional machine learning, deep learning, and dual contrastive learning techniques. The aim is to explore how different learning paradigms handle the complexity of multilingual and code-mixed text. Traditional models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest are compared against neural models like CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM. Further, dual contrastive learning is implemented to enhance feature discrimination by bringing semantically similar samples closer and separating dissimilar ones in the embedding space. The project also includes experiments on benchmark and custom-created datasets, providing a detailed performance comparison across methods.
